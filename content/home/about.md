# Hi!

My name is Ren√© Schmidt and I write code (mainly C++).

I work for [Bigpoint](http://www.bigpoint.com) in Berlin on [Drakensang Online](http://www.drakensang.com) as a Senior Developer and I focus on gameplay programming, especially combat and AI stuff, in a client-server-environment.

Before that I contributed code to several released and unreleased [PC, Wii and DS projects](http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,241905/) at [Radon Labs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon_Labs).

The main purpose of this site is to be an archive for personal projects. Astonishingly several project releases like the latest Hero Creator for Neverwinter Nights 2 are still downloaded regularly from this site. Keep in mind that all downloads are provided without warranty or support of any kind.
