# Hi!

My name is Ren√© Schmidt and I write code (most of the time C++).

I work for [Bigpoint](http://www.bigpoint.com) in Berlin on [Drakensang Online](http://www.drakensang.com) as a Senior Developer and I focus on gameplay programming, especially combat and AI, in a client-server-environment.

Before that I contributed code to several released and unreleased [PC, Wii and NDS projects](http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,241905/) at [Radon Labs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon_Labs).

This website serves as a portfolio and is also an archive for personal projects.
Astonishingly several of these like the latest NWN2 Hero Creator are still downloaded regularly from this site.

Please keep in mind that all downloads are provided without warranty or support of any kind.
